Summary: The experience of playing a mobile quarterback like Wilson had better help the Falcons prepare for Kaepernick, who is even more dangerous running the read-option behind a bullying offensive line. Otherwise, Atlanta will be in deep trouble. The Falcons did a solid job holding Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch to 46 rushing yards and forcing a fumble, but San Francisco’s ground game is even more prolific. The 49ers won’t get caught off-guard by Atlanta’s rushing attack like the Seahawks did with Michael Turner pacing the team’s season-high 167-yard effort with 98 yards. If Atlanta’s offensive line can hold up as well as it did against Seattle, Ryan will have the chance to make some hay downfield with wide receivers Roddy White and Julio Jones. 49ers wide receiver Michael Crabtree continued his hot play by scorching the Packers with nine catches for 119 yards and two scores. The Falcons know they can rely upon a clutch kicker in Bryant; the 49ers have to hope that David Akers is back on track after making his lone attempt against Green Bay.
Baltimore (12-6) at New England (13-4)
