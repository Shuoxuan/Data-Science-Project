  	<Name>Aresco</Name> dismissed talk that the Big East might reconsider its postseason ban for Connecticut's men's basketball team, allowing the Huskies play in this year's Big East tournament.
  	UConn was barred from the postseason by the NCAA because of previous low Academic Progress Rate scores, and the Big East followed suit. School officials have been lobbying against the ban, noting the team has improved those scores and no current players were involved in the previous problems.
  	''They've got a terrific APR now, they're doing much better,'' Aresco said. ''This is just one of those things. It happened, and it's something they're going to have to get through.''
