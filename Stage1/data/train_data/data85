With a world title and an Olympic silver medal of their own already, <Name>Meryl Davis</Name> and <Name>Charlie White</Name> were quite happy to share this latest accomplishment.
<Name>Davis</Name> and <Name>White</Name> won their fifth consecutive ice dance crown at the US Figure Skating Championships on Saturday, matching a record held by four other couples. As the audience stood and cheered, <Name>Davis</Name> knelt close to the ice for several seconds, her head bowed.
''Being in such an elite group of American ice dancers from the past and seeing that we belong with them, it's special,'' <Name>White</Name> said. ''All the hard work and our families and their dedication, our support group â€” you need a lot of things to come together to make that happen, including staying healthy. There are a lot of little things. I'm proud of us for being able to stick with it, and our continuing love for the sport has helped a lot.
