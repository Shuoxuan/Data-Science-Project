The only proof UFC flyweight champ <Name>Demetrious Johnson</Name> had of this birth father was the child support checks he sent.
An absentee birth father gave way to an abusive stepfather, who abandoned <Name>Johnson</Name>, his two siblings and his mother when <Name>Johnson</Name> was in first grade.
“I didn’t go through life thinking I was different from anybody else,” <Name>Johnson</Name> told FOXSports.com. “A lot of people were worse off than I was. You just took whatever you got and tried to make the most of it. My mom did a great job raising me. It was all her.”
<Name>Johnson</Name>, 26, hasn’t heard from his biological father even as he shot up the MMA ranks and prepared for the most hyped flyweight fight in history, Saturday’s UFC on FOX 6 main event against <Name>John Dodson</Name>.
