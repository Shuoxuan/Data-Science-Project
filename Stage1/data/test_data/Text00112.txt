  	Second-Year Performers
  	While we lament the decision to leave RGIII on the field and his subsequent surgery, we must applaud <Name>Mike</Name> and <Name>Kyle Shanahan</Name> for leaving the running back shuffle in the past. <Name>Alfred Morris</Name> amassed 1,613 rushing yards overall with 13 touchdowns and dominated opponents down the stretch. He rushed for more than 76 yards in all but two games this season and carried the ball at least 20 times in seven consecutive games to close out 2012. I still fear Shanahan turning back to his old ways in 2013, particularly with RGIIIâ€™s injury on the board. Still, <Name>Morris</Name> will be a mid-RB1 entering 2013 fantasy drafts.
