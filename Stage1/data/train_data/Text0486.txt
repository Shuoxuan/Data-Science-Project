The former Detroit Pistons star led the Detroit Shock to three WNBA titles and was 137-93 as the team's general manager and coach from 2002-09.
 ''I am very excited to return to the WNBA, and for the opportunity to join the New York Liberty,'' <Name>Laimbeer</Name> said. ''I missed the competitive fire of players like <Name>Cappie Pondexter</Name> and <Name>Plenette Pierson</Name>, two hard-nosed competitors for the Liberty. The commitment of our fans and the city will be invaluable in our quest to bring a WNBA championship to New York. After all, that's really all that counts.''
