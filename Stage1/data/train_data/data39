<Name>Lee</Name> gave the Warriors their first All-Star since <Name>Latrell Sprewell</Name> in 1997, but coach <Name>Mark Jackson</Name> and his team hoped for more. However, <Name>Stephen Curry</Name> wasn't selected despite averaging 20.9 points. He's the league's eighth-leading scorer and the highest one who won't be in Houston for the Feb. 17 showcase.
<Name>Lee</Name> called his selection ''bittersweet'' because <Name>Curry</Name> - the first person to send him a congratulatory text - wasn't picked.
''In our practice facility, there's that All-Star chart and it stops at '97 and there hasn't been any since. So the whole team was really excited with the improved record this year and to get one or both of our guys on there,'' <Name>Lee</Name> said. ''I'm really excited to be the one that goes and represents our team. I wish <Name>Steph</Name> could be a part of it and maybe he'll still be able to. I'm just very, very excited. It's been a long time for the Bay Area fans. Not only to have an All-Star, but to be winning games.''
