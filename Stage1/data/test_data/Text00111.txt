  	Panathinaikos, knowing victory was their only means of qualifying for the knockout stages, threw everything at Tottenham and looked the more likely to score before <Name>Clint Dempsey</Name> - whose shot went in after hitting both the bar and keeper <Name>Orestis Karnezis</Name> - and <Name>Jermain Defoe</Name> settled the game late on.
  	First Dempsey's header home <Name>Kyle Walker</Name>'s cross made it 2-1 and Defoe killed the game off with his 13th goal of the season with seven minutes left.
  	It was hardly Tottenham's most vintage performance of the season - and the game itself was largely poor in quality - but <Name>Andre Villas-Boas</Name> will sleep easier tonight knowing his team are one step closer to lifting the cup that he won with Porto in 2010.
