''It is truly an honor to be named by the NBA's coaches to the 2013 Western Conference All-Star team,'' he said in a statement. ''I am grateful for this opportunity and look forward to playing with the best players in the world.''
The leaders of the teams with the best winning percentage in their conference through games of Feb. 3 will be the coaches. Miami's <Name>Erik Spoelstra</Name> has the inside track on the East spot, while San Antonio's <Name>Gregg Popovich</Name> and the Clippers' <Name>Vinny Del Negro</Name> are battling for the West honor since <Name>Scott Brooks</Name>, whose Thunder have the league's best record, is ineligible after coaching last year.
<Name>Irving</Name>, the reigning Rookie of the Year, and Holiday were rewarded for outstanding individual seasons even though their teams are well below .500. <Name>Irving</Name> is the Cavaliers' first All-Star since <Name>James</Name>, the only other East player averaging at least 20 points and five assists.
