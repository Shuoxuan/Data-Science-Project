Crowe didn’t approve of <Name>Johnson</Name> wrestling as a youth. That could be one explanation why MMA is never a topic of conversation.
“We don’t talk about fighting at all,” <Name>Johnson</Name> said. “I don’t think she’s a big fight fan. I don’t see her saying, ‘Ooh. There’s a big <Name>Alistair Overeem</Name> fight. I have to make sure I’m home in time to watch it.’”
<Name>Johnson</Name> might not be able to convert his mother just yet. As far as the rest of the national TV audience, <Name>Johnson</Name> said he’s more concerned with winning matches than winning fans.
“I am excited for this opportunity, and I love the fact that this is the main event on FOX,” <Name>Johnson</Name> said. “Still, it doesn’t change anything for me. They can put this event on PBS after ‘Sesame Street’ and I’d approach it exactly the same.”
