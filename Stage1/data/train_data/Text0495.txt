<Name>LeRoy Butler</Name> would try to guess the number of concussions he suffered as an NFL player, but he knows any attempt to pinpoint specifics is futile.

"The word 'concussions' was not prevalent," said <Name>Butler</Name>, who played with the Green Bay Packers during his entire NFL career (1990-2001). "When we played, it was just that your bell got rung or you've got cobwebs. It wasn't widely known that you just went through trauma to the head."
