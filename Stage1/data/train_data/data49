''It was hard, that much I could tell you,'' he said. ''I was reaching for the puck and didn't brace myself enough, <Name>Stuart</Name> stepped up and that's the way hockey always is. It was a big one. I knew he was there but I didn't think he was coming at me. Then he came and I saw him at the last second but not nearly early enough.''
<Name>O'Byrne</Name> took offense and challenged Stuart to a fight. The Sharks came out of the scrum with two power plays after <Name>O'Byrne</Name> got hit with an instigator penalty and one for fighting with a facemask. <Name>Landeskog</Name> left the game briefly before returning for the second period.
