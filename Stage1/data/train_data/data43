''It's one of the best days of my life,'' <Name>Irving</Name> said Thursday night, shortly after also being honored as Cleveland's professional athlete of the year award at the Greater Cleveland Sports Awards. ''It's a big deal for me and it's a big deal for the city of Cleveland to be picked as an All-Star for the first time. I'm turning 21 on March 23 and to be with those guys, to see those names on TV, that was truly a blessing.''
The 22-year-old Holiday, the youngest All-Star in franchise history, is averaging 19.0 points and 9.0 assists but feared the 76ers' 17-25 mark would work against him.
''I thought so. I definitely thought so. I think anybody else probably would, too,'' he said while watching a Philadelphia Flyers game. ''We're not getting on a winning streak or anything like that. I just tried to stay positive and not talk about it.''
