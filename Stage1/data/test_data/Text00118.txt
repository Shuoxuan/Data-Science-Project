  	Iâ€™ll spare the lengthy analysis of <Name>Alshon Jeffery</Name> and <Name>Kendall Wright</Name> here. Both flashed signs of becoming big-time performers in 2012. Jeffery had his rookie season upended by injury, while Wright battled a crowded receiving corps and inconsistent quarterback play. Likewise, Chris Givens amassed 42 receptions and demonstrated great downfield play-making ability for Sam Bradford. The Rams will be interesting to watch in year two for <Name>Jeff Fisher</Name>.
