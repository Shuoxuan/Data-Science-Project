Minnesota was embarrassed by its play in Game 3, but is focused on the fact that they can still win the title.
''We are disappointed with yesterday,'' Minnesota forward <Name>Rebekkah Brunson</Name> said. ''That is done and over with. We can't do anything about that. We have to be optimistic about tomorrow and being able to do what we have to do. We haven't lost any confidence we still know what we are capable of doing. So we are just going to step on the court tomorrow and prove it.''
<Name>Catchings</Name> knows how talented the Lynx are - she played with <Name>Seimone Augustus</Name>, <Name>Maya Moore</Name> and <Name>Lindsay Whalen</Name> on the U.S. Olympic team at the London Games during the summer. Anything less than absolute focus could extend the series.
