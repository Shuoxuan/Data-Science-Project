<Name>Brad Friedel</Name> made his first start in a month as <Name>Tottenham</Name> booked their place in the knockout stages of the Europa League with a 3-1 against Panathinaikos at White Hart Lane.
  	Needing just a draw to progress, Spurs had an air of complacency about them in the opening period, which Panathinaikos controlled for large parts.
  	<Name>Emmanuel Adebayor</Name> put <Name>Tottenham</Name> ahead just before the half hour, but the Greeks, who have never won in Britain, played the better football and deservedly equalised through Zeca just after the re-start.
