  	<Name>Daryl Richardson</Name> earned the second slot in the St. Louis backfield behind Steven Jackson and amassed more than 600 total yards. Heâ€™ll be challenged in 2013 by Isaiah Pead, who slid off the radar after being selected in the second round. Pead logged only 10 carries in 2012, five of which came in the season finale against Seattle. I expect Pead to slide ahead on the depth chart and become a formidable No. 2 behind Jackson.
