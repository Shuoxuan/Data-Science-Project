  	For most of the day, he looked like his old self, too.
  	<Name>Clarke</Name> repeatedly sent 3-pointers over the outstretched arms of defenders, confounding and frustrating them at the same time.
  	He drove relentlessly through the lane, crashing hard to the floor once in each half. Yes, it brought back memories of that Jan. 12 play at Dayton when he crashed head first into a padded basket support head first and then stayed down for eight minutes before being taken off on a stretcher. On Saturday, <Name>Clarke</Name>, thankfully, bounced up right away both times as he continued to play his way.
