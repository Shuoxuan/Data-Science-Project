Ravens player to watch: Left tackle <Name>Bryant McKinnie</Name>. Now that he has gotten back into shape and out of head coach <Name>John Harbaugh</Name>’s doghouse, <Name>McKinnie</Name> has helped stabilize an offensive line that did a masterful job protecting Flacco against Indianapolis and Denver. The Ravens also may be catching a break as Patriots rookie defensive end <Name>Chandler Jones</Name> (45 tackles, six sacks in the regular season) suffered an ankle injury in the second quarter against Houston and didn’t return.
Patriots player to watch: Defensive tackle <Name>Vince Wilfork</Name>. He was a beast in last year’s AFC title game win over the Ravens, registering six tackles (three for losses) and one sack as well as creating plays for others by overwhelming Baltimore’s offensive line late in the game. Wilfork’s play didn’t dip in 2012 as he recently earned first-team All-Pro honors for the first time in his nine-year NFL career.
