  	<Name>Ronnie Hillman</Name> was expected to become “the man” when <Name>Willis McGahee</Name> was injured midway through the 2012 season. Instead, <Name>Knowshon Moreno</Name> emerged from nowhere to claim the top slot and produced fantastic numbers to help fuel the 11-game winning streak. <Name>Hillman</Name> produced 330 rushing yards on 85 attempts this season (3.9 yards per carry). I’m not ready to bury him yet, but the team will certainly have some interesting decisions to make at the position. He’s worthy of a late-round flier given the current roster composition with upside.
