  	<Name>Chip Kelly</Name> reportedly talked about <Name>Colt McCoy</Name> as a viable option for the Browns during his short-lived flirtation with the squad. I don’t see how Brandon Weeden was dismissed so quickly after passing for nearly 3,400 yards (3,385) with 14 touchdowns against 17 interceptions (he missed the finale). There’s a very nice core in Cleveland with <Name>Trent Richardson</Name>, speedster <Name>Josh Gordon</Name> and <Name>Greg Little</Name>.
