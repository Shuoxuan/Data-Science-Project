"We said we were going to do better and we did a little better than last time (France 2011) with one more gold medal. Eight medals is what we can expect. It's early in the season, we have a young team. I'm really happy with it. All of the women went to the final and only three of the guys didn't, so that's a great achievement. We're in great shape because we have a lot of young athletes coming up through the system."
