Indiana will be without reserve guard <Name>Jeanette Pohlen</Name> for the rest of the series. The Fever announced that she tore the ACL in her left knee during Game 2 in Minneapolis. Fever guard <Name>Katie Douglas</Name> has missed the whole series with a sprained left ankle.
Minnesota didn't seem concerned about either situation.
''Them being down two players has nothing to do with anything,'' <Name>Brunson</Name> said. ''They have been playing well without them.
