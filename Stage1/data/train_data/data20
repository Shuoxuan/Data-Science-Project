Much of the nation has the opportunity as well since his bout will be on broadcast TV. It has been hyped as “world championship,” not a flyweight title fight. It's both.
Makes sense. This is a new division --- <Name>Johnson</Name> (16-2-1) beat <Name>Joseph Benavidez</Name> via a split decision to become the first UFC flyweight champ in September --- and respect has been hard to come by for a weight class that has a cutoff of 125 pounds.
His fight against <Name>Benavidez</Name> drew boos from the fans in Toronto despite it being one of the most active of the night in the Octagon. UFC president <Name>Dana White</Name> reacted harshly to the jeers both in the arena and on Twitter.
