''I don't know if he can keep scoring two goals every night. But he can keep his play up the way it's been,'' coach <Name>Todd McLellan</Name> said. ''He's been skating extremely well. A ton of confidence. He's prepared to shoot the puck. He's engaged physically. It's a great reward for him. He came focused to play.''
The Sharks took more than 12 minutes to get their first shot on goal, but managed to take a 2-0 lead in the first period because of stellar special teams play and a big hit by <Name>Stuart</Name> that changed the complexion of the game.
San Jose's troubled penalty-kill unit was up to the task early, allowing no shots on two power plays for Colorado. Then San Jose's dangerous power-play took over late in the period after <Name>Stuart</Name>'s big hit that <Name>Landeskog</Name> felt was clean even if his coach thought it should have been a penalty.
