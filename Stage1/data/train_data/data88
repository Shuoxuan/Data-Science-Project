For generations, Americans weren't even an afterthought in ice dance. They were so far below the world powerhouses it's a good bet the Russians and British didn't even know their names.
But that has changed in the last 10 years, and <Name>Davis</Name> and <Name>White</Name> now set the standard in the sport. Their rivalry with Canada's <Name>Tessa Virtue</Name> and <Name>Scott Moir</Name> is the best thing going, with the training partners playing a game of ''Can you top this?'' <Name>Virtue</Name> and <Name>Moir</Name> edged the Americans at the Vancouver Olympics, as well as at the 2010 and 2012 world championships. The Americans won the world title in 2011, as well as the last four Grand Prix finals.
Though they have no peers in the United States, that doesn't mean they coast when they come to nationals.
Far from it.
