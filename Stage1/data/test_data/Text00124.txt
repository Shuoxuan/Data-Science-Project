  	The Texans continue their search for a No. 2 receiving option opposite <Name>Andre Johnson</Name>. Sure, <Name>Owen Daniels</Name> has been a steady option over the middle with an occasional deep throw in the mix, but there’s not a steady downfield option otherwise (it’s no longer <Name>Kevin Walter</Name>’s run). <Name>Keshawn Martin</Name>, a fourth-round pick out of Michigan State, caught 10 passes for 85 yards while operating as a return man for the Texans in 2012.
