Reviewing the second round: A regular-season win over Houston in Week 14 helped the Patriots edge the Texans for a first-round playoff bye and home-field advantage in the divisional round. New England didn’t squander it by posting a 41-28 victory at Gillette Stadium. The Ravens, who lost to Denver in Week 15, were far more successful in their rematch with a 38-35 triumph over the Broncos in double-overtime. The victory, though, was improbable as quarterback <Name>Joe Flacco</Name> connected with <Name>Jacoby Jones</Name> on a 70-yard touchdown pass with 31 seconds left in regulation to tie the score. The Patriots had an easier time with Houston, holding a double-digit lead for nearly the entire second half. Leading the way was quarterback <Name>Tom Brady</Name>, who threw for 344 yards and three touchdowns without a turnover.
Last meeting: <Name>Justin Tucker</Name>’s 27-yard field goal as time expired gave Baltimore a 31-30 home win in Week 3. Ravens wide receiver <Name>Torrey Smith</Name>’s big day Saturday against the Broncos — three catches for 98 yards and two touchdowns — should come as no surprise to the Patriots. <Name>Smith</Name> was even more effective against New England with 127 yards and two scores on six receptions.
