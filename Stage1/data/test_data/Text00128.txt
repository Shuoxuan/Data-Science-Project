<Name>Travis Benjamin</Name>, a fourth-round pick from Miami, caught 18-of-37 targets for 298 yards with two touchdowns and demonstrated some big-play potential of his own. I’ll be curious to see how he’s used once the new coaching staff gets put in place. Could he pile up short receptions with some YAC? <Name>Benjamin</Name>’s a true longshot option in this category.
