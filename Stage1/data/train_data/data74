''Don't let your highs get you too high and let your lows get you too low,'' she said Saturday. ''I felt like we celebrated too much after Game 3 in 2009 and we came out in Game 4 and had an opportunity and we let it slip away.''
The Fever are in position to win the title, in part, because of <Name>Shavonte Zellous</Name>' career-high 30 points on Friday. Indiana led 70-33 late in the third quarter, the largest lead ever for a team in a finals game.
