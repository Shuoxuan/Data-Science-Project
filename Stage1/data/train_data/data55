49ers player to watch: Tight end <Name>Vernon Davis</Name>. An afterthought since <Name>Kaepernick</Name> replaced <Name>Alex Smith</Name> as San Francisco’s starting quarterback, <Name>Davis</Name> had a 44-yard catch down the seam against Green Bay that led to a 49ers touchdown. <Name>Davis</Name> was targeted five times overall by <Name>Kaepernick</Name>. He could get even more opportunities Sunday considering the damage caused by Seattle tight end <Name>Zach Miller</Name> (eight catches for 142 yards and one touchdown) against Atlanta’s defense.
Falcons player to watch: Defensive end <Name>John Abraham</Name>. The NFL’s active leader in sacks (122) aggravated an ankle injury late in the second quarter against Seattle and didn’t return. Without him on the field, the Falcons couldn’t sack <Name>Seahawks</Name> quarterback <Name>Russell Wilson</Name> in the fourth quarter on his 13 pass attempts. <Name>Abraham</Name> is Atlanta’s only major pass-rushing threat, leading the team with 10 this season. No other Falcons defender had more than four sacks during the regular season.
