  	<Name>Jarius Wright</Name> closed out the season well, producing eight receptions (14 targets) for 143 yards in the final two games against the Texans and Packers. He amassed 22 receptions for 310 yards overall, including a huge 65-yard touchdown reception against Green Bay. Wright will take on a much larger role in his second year whether Percy Harvin returns to Minnesota or not. Obviously, there’s still a huge question at quarterback (are you a Ponder believer?), but there’s speed and downfield capability here.
