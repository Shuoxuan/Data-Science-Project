Reviewing the second round: With 31 seconds remaining in Sunday’s game between Seattle and Atlanta in the Georgia Dome, <Name>Marshawn Lynch</Name> scored on a 2-yard run and it appeared a third matchup this season between NFC West rivals was in the offing. The Falcons, though, drove 41 yards in 23 seconds for <Name>Matt Bryant</Name>’s game-winning field goal with eight seconds remaining to seal a 30-28 victory over Seattle, meaning the 49ers would be headed to Atlanta rather than hosting the Seahawks next weekend. San Francisco didn’t have to sweat nearly as much, blowing open a 45-31 home win over Green Bay in the second half. San Francisco’s <Name>Colin Kaepernick</Name> set an NFL single-game rushing record for a quarterback with 181 yards and two touchdowns. He also passed for 263 more yards and another two scores. Falcons quarterback <Name>Matt Ryan</Name> wasn’t as spectacular, but he did complete two passes for 41 yards on the final drive to put <Name>Bryant</Name> in position for his 49-yard kick. The win marked <Name>Ryan</Name>’s 22nd career fourth-quarter/overtime comeback and his first career playoff victory.
Last meeting: The Falcons and 49ers haven’t met since Week 4 of the 2010 season at the Georgia Dome. At that time, <Name>Mike Singletary</Name> was San Francisco’s head coach and <Name>Kaepernick</Name> was playing at the University of Nevada. The Falcons won, 16-14, when <Name>Bryant</Name> hit a 43-yard field goal with two seconds remaining.
