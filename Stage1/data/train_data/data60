He said: "It was the desire of the club to sign me up which was the most important factor.
"It was nothing to do with the league position. It was really all about the club's desire and willingness to sign me up.
"Also, I like the club's ambition to strengthen the whole team so we can improve our league position. That's what appealed to me, so I didn't hesitate."
Toon boss <Name>Alan Pardew</Name> added: "<Name>Massadio</Name> is very highly thought of in France and he's somebody who our scouting team have been greatly impressed by.
"At the age of 20, he will only continue to get better but he's already played a lot of games in his country's top division and represented France at under-19, under-20 and under-21 level.
"He's strong and quick and we're looking forward to seeing him develop here."
