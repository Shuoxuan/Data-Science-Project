 	You can hope for the <Name>Adrian Peterson</Name>-inspired return from RGIII in 2013. I will give <Name>Mike Shanahan</Name> credit for securing a second option in the 2012 NFL Draft. <Name>Kirk Cousins</Name> slides into the starter role during <Name>Griffin III</Name>â€™s absence and becomes a mid-QB2 fantasy option.
